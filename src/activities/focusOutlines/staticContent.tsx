      Once when I was trying out some new computer program, I tried to change
      the size of my mouse cursor and I accidentally made it invisible instead.
      I tried to change it back, but I had no idea where I was on the page so it
      was almost impossible to click the right button!
    </p>

    <p>
      That's what it's like for keyboard users on so many websites. They have
      often have no way of knowing where they are on a page, so it's hard (or
      near impossible!) to get to the content they want.
    </p>
    <p>
      When tabbing between interactive elements like buttons, links and form
      inputs, the elements should all have focus outlines to let users know
      where they are on the page.

    TLDR: Focus outline = I can I'm about to press that button. No focus outline
    = I have no idea what button I'm on
  </>
);
